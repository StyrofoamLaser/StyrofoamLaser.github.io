<p>This week saw the (almost) completion of the reworked C++ enemies. I finished filling out their functionality and created a Blueprint class inheriting from MeleeEnemy to test them out. After bug fixing and fiddling with settings for a night or two, I finally got our enemy acting just as expected. All that they still require is pathfinding code, which rely on Kyle's system that he is in the process of writing. There may be some other tweaks to make after that, but they will be minor. After finishing with that, I focused on helping the designers and artists spice up the look of the game for our upcoming presentation on Monday. This mostly comprised of implementing new assets and style for the UI and fretboard stuff. We are finally using a more "metal" font now, as well as some really kickass looking assets for our notes and fretboard. On top of that, Justin did an overhaul of the level and added an extra layer of polish and shine to everything. Finally, I sat down with Matt from the design team and discussed the Boss fight in more detail, settling on the first feature to begin implementing, the Grudge bar. This bar will effectively act like a rock-based tug of war between Dan Shredder and the Devil as they struggle to best each other. Should be awesome!</p>

<p>With our plan for the first few weeks set, this week was the time to start getting into the meat of the game's systems. Since our first order of business was transfer code over from blueprints to native C++, I spent much of my time this week implementing the Enemy class hierarchy. Using the designs we discussed last week, I built upon the Enemy base class and inherited from it in the MeleeEnemy and RangedEnemy. The goal with these new enemy classes is to create a C++ class with the backbone of Enemy functionality that can then be extended by a Blueprint. This will mean that a designer can simply create a subclass of MeleeEnemy or RangedEnemy and then override the various functions such as Attack() or Path() to behave however they want. Meanwhile, other members of the programming team are working on doing similar refactoring work in other areas of the game. The current plan is to be finished with the rework in time for QA testing on Monday February 8th. After that point my job will be to work directly with the designers as a gameplay programmer, with the first item on the agenda being an awesome boss fight!</p>

<p>This marks the first week of work for the second semester of Dan Shredder. The team has met a few times, made our plans and its time to finally get started with the code. I met with the other programmers and we started structuring the new architecture for the enemy classes. Kyle, our Lead Programmer, decided early on that our first priority should be transferring existing systems from blueprints to C++ code in order to improve framerates and efficiency. First on the list for this conversion were the enemies, as they currently have some of the most bloated blueprints. Here is our crude diagram of the new class structure:</p>
        
        <img src="images/enemy_class_diagram.jpg" alt="Enemy Class Diagram" style="width:384px;height:512px;">
        
<p>As such, I began creating an "Enemy" base class in C++ that we can adapt all of the games enemies as subclasses of. Hopefully this will mean that the game runs better and is much easier on the programmers and the designers in terms of future development.</p>
