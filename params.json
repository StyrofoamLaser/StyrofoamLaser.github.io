You play as Dan Shredder and wield the power of rock to battle demons. Players utilize a guitar controller as well as a dance pad to select enemies and defeat them by playing musical riffs. I worked on Dan Shredder as a gameplay programmer, working closely with the game's designers on implementing features in the Unreal 4 engine.\r\n\r\n### Getting Away With Murder\r\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT](http://img.youtube.com/vi/EhYMsCk8lZ0/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhYMsCk8lZ0 \"Getting Away With Murder Trailer\")\r\n\r\nGetting Away With Murder is a 5 player asymmetrical multiplayer game with a spooky atmosphere. 4 players team up as the Murderers, having recently broken into a mansion and murdered it's owner.
