<p>Hi! My name is Cody Carlson. I'm currently a student at Champlain College in Burlington VT, working on my Bachelor's of Science in Electronic Game Programming. I am super passionate about developing fun and innovative games and sharing them with the world. Here on my portfolio you can find some example projects I have worked on over the years. I hope you enjoy exploring!</p>

<p>Put trailer here!</p>

<p>Dan Shredder in Hellzone is a badass rail-based adventure through the depths of hell. You play as Dan Shredder and wield the power of rock to battle demons. Players utilize a guitar controller as well as a dance pad to select enemies and defeat them by playing musical riffs. I worked on Dan Shredder as a gameplay programmer, working closely with the game's designers on implementing features in the Unreal 4 engine.</p>
